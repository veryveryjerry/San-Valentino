My Dearest Nico,

Three years. Three years of laughter, adventures, quiet nights, and a love that has blossomed into something so much more beautiful than I could have ever imagined. As I sit here trying to put my feelings into words, I'm overwhelmed with gratitude for you, for us, and for everything we've built together.

Remember that awkward first date at that little Italian place downtown? I was so nervous, but you, with your warm smile and kind eyes, immediately put me at ease. From that moment on, you've had this incredible ability to make me feel seen, understood, and loved in a way I never thought possible. It's like we just click. We're two pieces of a puzzle that fit together perfectly, even with all my… quirks.

And you do get me, Nico. You understand my dumb ass in a way no one else does. You embrace it, even. You love me, flaws and all, and that's one of the most incredible gifts I've ever received. You see the best in me, even when I struggle to see it myself.

Spending time with you is my absolute favorite thing in the world. Whether we're running away from governments for illegal overstay, or just simply being in each other's presence eating and FUCKING, HARD, I feel a sense of peace and happiness that I can't find anywhere else. You make even the most mundane moments feel special.

These past three years haven't been perfect, of course. We've had our disagreements, our challenges, our moments of doubt. But what I cherish most is how we've navigated those storms together, always emerging stronger and more connected on the other side. You've taught me the true meaning of partnership, of unwavering support, and of unconditional love.

You're not just my girlfriend, Nico. You're my best friend, my confidante, my biggest cheerleader, and the chicken to my shawarma. You celebrate my triumphs, you comfort me in my struggles, and you inspire me to be a better person every single day.

I love your infectious laugh. I love the way you hold my hand, your smile, your lips, your hair, your hips, the way your pussy feels in my finger tips, youre my woman and I will be with you till death and after(God willing). I love everything about you, inside and out.

And speaking of the future… I'm working so hard to find the right job, and I can't wait until I do. I dream of the day we can finally close the distance between us, start a family, and build our life together in the same home the way we always dreamt. I can't imagine a future without you by my side.

Thank you for being you, Nico. Thank you for choosing me., completly believeing in me, standing on business, coming here to be with me for good. Thank you for three amazing years. Here's to many more.

With all my love,
Jeremuuuu
Cheers
